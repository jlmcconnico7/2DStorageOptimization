# 2DStorageOptimization
Program that packs rectangular objects into a 2D space. With the user-given dimensions of the space you are packing objects into, and a list of boxes and their dimensions, the program will output how many boxes were packed, which boxes were packed, which boxes were not packed, and how much space on the truck is left unfilled. It will also display the layout in which the boxes were packed.
